        Hello! My name is Daniel Zhu and I am a 4th year UCSD student majoring in Math and Economics with a minor in Data Science. Previously, I have interned as a business analyst and machine learning engineer at a couple of startups. Outside of my academic and professional life, some of my hobbies include photography, music production, and travelling. Feel free to connect with me at d4zhu@ucsd.edu.
